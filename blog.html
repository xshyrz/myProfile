  <h3>College Journey <i>(Present)</i> ⚝</h3>
  <p class="desc">
    <i>Every line of code I write is a step forward not just in syntax, but in self-discovery. 
      This is more than a college journey. It’s a coding journey and it’s just getting started.
    </i></p>

  <p class="desc">Entering college felt like stepping into a world of infinite possibilities. 
    I wasn’t just learning subjects. I was learning how to build, solve, and express myself 
    through technology. My journey began with curiosity and a blank screen, and slowly evolved 
    into a passion for programming languages that helped me shape ideas into reality. </p>

  <p class="desc">Python taught me how to think logically and break problems 
    into manageable steps. From simple loops to object-oriented design, it became my tool for 
    clarity and structure. Java language challenged me to be precise and disciplined. 
    Its strict syntax and powerful architecture pushed me to understand how real-world applications 
    are built — and how patience leads to mastery. C language brought me closer to the machine. 
    It showed me how memory works, how systems run, and how low-level logic powers everything we take 
    for granted. It was tough, but it made me resilient. HTML and CSS gave me a canvas. 
    They allowed me to design interfaces that reflect not just functionality, but personality. With 
    every tag and style, I learned how to make my work visually meaningful and emotionally resonant. </p>

  <p class="desc">Together, these languages became more than just tools, they became my voice. Through them, 
    I’ve built projects, solved problems, and told stories that matter to me. And as I continue this 
    journey, I know that every bug I fix, every feature I build, and every page I design is part of a bigger 
    picture <i>becoming the kind of creator who blends logic with heart.</i>

  <h3>Freshman Year ⚝</h3>
  <p class="desc">
    <i>Stepping into college as a freshman feels like opening a brand-new book — one where the
    pages are blank, waiting to be filled with stories of growth, challenge, and discovery. </i></p>

  <p class="desc">
    The transition from high school to college is more than just a change in schedule or 
    environment, it’s a shift in mindset. Suddenly, you're surrounded by new faces, unfamiliar
    hallways, and expectations that stretch beyond academics. It’s exciting, but also intimidating.
    You start asking questions like: <i>Will I fit in? Can I handle this? Who am I becoming? </i></p>

  <p class="desc">
    But here’s the truth, being a freshman isn’t about having it all figured out, it’s about learning
    how to figure things out. You learn to navigate your campus, your courses, and your own
    independence. You meet people who challenge your perspective, professors who push your limits,
    and moments that test your resilience. And slowly, you begin to realize that every awkward introduction,
    every late-night study session, and every small win is shaping you into someone stronger, wiser,
    and more confident. 
  </p>

  <p class="desc">
    Freshman year is the beginning of your transformation — not just academically, but personally.
    It’s where you start building the foundation for your dreams, one step at a time. So if you're feeling
    overwhelmed, remember: <i>Every great journey starts with a first step. And this is yours. </i></p>

  <h3>Senior High School Ends ⚝</h3>

    High School Graduation or should I say an event that marked my High School journey <i>"The End".</i>
    Gone with the highschool life, gone those moments that we can still be able to make projects
    together, gone the study sessions with those peeps who I am with in this journey, gone the teasing 
    of puppy love and crushes. With love and hate on our school, I can't deny the fact that I will 
    miss walking through the hallways of the buildings, going to canteen everytime, and those teacher's 
    that never gave up on our stubbornness. </p>
    
  <p class="desc">
    Memories that I will keep forever, silently missing a lot of people, reminiscing those laughters 
    and cries over a paperworks. Those are just a few of an event in my highschool journey that I just 
    realized upon looking at the crowd with my fellow student graduates. The place where I met most of
    my bestfriends and a lot of aquiantances. The place where I discovered different versions of myself
    that I never thought I had. In the middle of the crowd, watching my fellow graduates makes me proud.
    We've achieved another milestone! And I don't think we're ready for the next one though. </p>

  <h3>Basic Knowledge of Programming ⚝</h3>
  <p class="desc">
    In my Senior High School journey taking Information and Communications Technology, I have
    start learning many basics of java, html, and css. With the guide of our advisers, I've learned
    how to manipulate format text in html, how to have a creative design in css and how to make user
    interface in java. It was so fun coding until you have an error. But we can't really avoid
    errors especially that I was still a beginner, well, in the present I still struggle to learn
    programming. But we don't stop learning, do we? </p>
  <p class="desc">
    This is not what I want, but I trust God's plan to take this path. True enough I enjoyed
    learning about programming, everytime I learned something that is pleasing in my eyes I can't 
    help but be amazed on how it was done. I wanted to learn more on creating applications someday, 
    making a creative website and webpage, and learning animations. </p>
  <p class="desc">
    Maybe someday, with these knowledge I have and will have, will help us to succeed in life.
    To make a difference in our country and to inspire others with our works. I once dream to have
    a successful life and give my family a better life than what we are now. I do believe on what
    Baz Luhrmann's quote, <i>trust yourself that you can do it</i> . Trust in youself and maybe
    when the time is right God will give more than what we asked for. </p>

  <h3>New Chapter in Life ⚝</h3>

  </div>
  <p class="desc">
    Stepping into a new chapter of life with these amazing peeps who were my constant source 
    of support and courage to continue. Laughing together over a random jokes, making projects,
    small talk whenever there were no class in that period, sometimes having a open forum to
    let out our feelings and emotions, and many more memories with them. I can say that stepping into Senior
    High School was the start of my fun studying journey for I — We were not be able to attend face to 
    face classes during our Junior High School due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So I was thankful that
    I met them, they make my senior high school journey a remarkable one.
